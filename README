FVWM configuration
==================

This is an extremely sleek and efficient configuration of FVWM.  You
may not like it, I've adapted it to my needs over a timespan that may
very well span two decades.

  * There are no icons, there's no taskbar.

  * Focus follows the mouse.

  * Hit the Menu key to start programs.

  * Hold down the key with a window on it to interact with the
    window manager.

  * There's only one desktop, it is 3×3 pages (aka. viewports,
    screens) large.

  * Windows are stacked, and this stack is organised in three layers:
    normal, top, bottom.


Mouse interaction
-----------------

On the background:

  * *left* — Brings up the menu to launch programs.

  * *right* — Brings up window list.

  * *middle* — Brings up the menu with window actions (close, move, …).

On a window: Hold down the window-key with the first button press to
do this:

  * *left* — Raises or drags the window.

  * *right* — Lowers or resizes the window.

  * *middle* — Brings up a menu with window actions (close, move, …).


Keyboard interaction
--------------------

Hold down the window-key with the first key press to use any of the
following bindings.  Use further modifiers as listed:

  * *Tab* — Brings up the window list.  Contains all windows.
    Releasing the window key will jump to that window, and raise it.
    Hit Window-Tab again to swap between two windows in
    least-recently-focused order.  If a new window is mapped, it is
    either focused when under the pointer, or it will be the next
    window in that order.  Without releasing the window key,
    repeatedly typing Tab moves forwards, Shift-Tab moves backwards in
    that list.

  * `d` — Ask the program to close the window.  With Shift, destroys
    the window, might kill the program.

  * `i` — Iconify the window.  Icons are never shown, so this basically
    hides the window.  Use the windows list (Window-Tab or right click
    on the background) to find it again.  Iconified windows appear at
    the bottom.

  * `m` — Move the window.

  * `r` — Resize the window.

  * `s` — Toggle the window's stickyness.  Sticky windows stick to the
    screen instead of the desktop, i.e., appear fixed when moving the
    viewport to other pages.

  * The *cursor* keys — Move the screen (i.e., your viewport) to the
    page of the desktop which is adjacent in that direction.  Default
    is a 3×3 pages desktop.  With *Shift*, move a window there, but do
    not change the viewport.  With *Ctrl*, go there and take a window
    with you.  With *Meta* (aka. *Alt*), move a window to the edge of
    the screen in that direction.

  * *PgUp*/*PgDn*, aka. *Prior*/*Next* — Raise/lower this window within
     its layer.  With *Shift*, move the window to the top/bottom
     layer.

  * *Return* — Put a window in the normal layer, at the top.

  * `x`, `y`, and `z` — Maximize the window in x, y, or both
    directions.  With Shift, set to 50% in that direction.  This is
    not implemented nicely.


Config files
------------

The file `config` contains the main look and feel described here.  It
will read the files `menu` and `styles`.  The former should
contain the menu structure you desire to launch programs, and also
hotkeys to launch programs.  The latter should contain styles required
for individual programs.  The idea is that `config` should be somewhat
stable across different machines, while the other two may differ
depending on what's available there.


Used scripts
------------

The basic `config` uses only very few executables: `notify-send`,
`xterm`, `nano`, and `i3lock`.
